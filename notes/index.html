CoDel determines standing queue by tracking the minimum packet delay through a buffer over a sliding time window, where the window is on the order of a round trip time (delay measured at each packet\'s departure as its time spent in the buffer). If the minimum packet delay exceeds the small target standing queue for longer than a time interval on the order of a round trip time, a packet is dropped and a control law used to set the next drop time. As soon as a packet delay at or below target is seen, drops are canceled. This ensures that delay must have persisted for a network-significant amount of time.\n\nUsing **packet time spent enqueued as the input to the local congestion controller** results in an AQM that works at any link bandwidth, including one that is time varying. Target and interval are constants: acceptable queue delay (to prevent starvation) and a time on the order of a worst case RTT of connections through the bottleneck. Tracking the recently experienced standing queue means CoDel reacts to congestion and its removal in a timely fashion and does not make drops that "starve" the buffer.\n\n#### MAN Page\nFQ_Codel (Fair Queuing Controlled Delay) is queuing discipline that combines Fair Queuing with the CoDel AQM scheme. FQ_Codel uses a stochastic model to classify incoming packets into different flows and is used to provide a fair share of the bandwidth to all the flows using the queue.\nEach such flow is managed by the CoDel queuing discipline. Reordering within a flow is avoided since Codel internally uses a FIFO queue.\n\n## Outlines\n##### CoDel\n- Active queue management (AQM) algorithm in network routing\n- Designed to overcome [BufferBloat](BufferBloat.md) in networking hardware, such as routers, by setting limits on the delay network packets experience as they pass through buffers in this equipment.\n##### FQ Codel\n- Flow Queue CoDel\n\n## Predessecors\n- [Random early detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_early_detection)\n- [Codel vs RED](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2209336)\n## Advances\n- [The Cake Algoritm](The%20Cake%20Algoritm.md)\n\n## References\n[Controlled Delay](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8289/)\n[FqCodel](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8290/)\n[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoDel)\n[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/blog/codel-improved-networking-through-adaptively-managed-router-queues/)\n\n#networking \n#ActiveQueueManagement\n#QueueManagement',lastmodified:"2022-02-01T19:44:13.613530597Z",title:"CoDel - Fair Queuing (FQ) with Controlled Delay (CoDel)"},"/Coding-Uni-Prep-2426fa4977da4886af5828c04b8059ef":{content:"---\n# Coding Uni Prep\n\n# Coding Interview University\n\n\u003e I originally created this as a short to-do list of study topics for becoming a software engineer, but it grew to the large list you see today.

Her team at **Google** leapt from 25 to 125 in just 9 months. During her 4+ years at **Facebook**, the company exploded from 500 employees serving 80 million users to 5,500 employees and over 1.1 billion users. (Her job was to sort out the culture, compensation, and performance systems to help make that possible — no big deal.) And now, as COO of productivity tool startup **[Quip](http://www.quip.com/ "null")**, she’s both laying the groundwork for her team to grow, and catering to a customer base of startups ([Instacart](http://www.instacart.com/ "null") and [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/ "null") among them) who have the pedal to the metal.\n\nIf there’s one thing Graham knows for sure, it’s that scaling comes with an utterly unique set of problems. Some of them are funny — like needing to replace everyone’s big desk with smaller ones so all the new folks can fit, or moving into an office that\'s already too small for your growing team. But some of them are far more serious.\n\n“If you’ve ever watched an extremely high performer go from killing it one year to struggling the next, you know what I’m talking about,” she says. “There’s a unique feeling of ambiguity, chaos and stress that comes with doubling or tripling your team every six months. If you don’t manage scaling proactively, you can end up in trouble.”\n\nHere, Graham explains why scaling companies and teams is, in her words (and she’s putting it lightly), “crazy hard” and what you can do as an early employee or a startup founder to make it easier on yourself and your team. She covers what rapid scaling actually feels like as an experience (something too few people talk about), the toughest phases of growth and how to survive them, and — most importantly — how you can anticipate the biggest challenges before they really hurt your momentum and your chances for long-term success.\n\n“I think it’s important for people to talk about what it feels like to be inside a scaling company because it helps people realize how normal their experience is — and identifying that experience as a leader can actually help your team,” says Graham. She saw so many people struggling with the same emotions during her time at Facebook that now she actually gives a talk to people on her teams about it. “I call it the ‘Give Away Your Legos’ talk,” she says.\n\n**Let her explain.**\n\n“The best metaphor I have for scaling is building one of those huge, complex towers out of Legos,” she says. “At first, everyone’s excited. Scaling a team is a privilege. Being inside a company that’s a rocket ship is really cool. There are so many Legos! You could build anything. At the beginning, as you start to scale, everyone has so many Legos to choose from — they’re doing 10 jobs — and they’re all part of building something important.”\n\nYou have so many choices and things to build during this early phase that it’s easy to get overwhelmed. There’s too much work — too many Legos. You’re not sure you can do it all yourself. Soon, you decide you need help. So you start to add people. That’s when something funny happens on a personal level and to teams: **People get nervous.**\n\n“As you add people, you go through this roller coaster of, ‘Wait, is that new person taking my job? What if they don’t do it the right way? What if they’re better than me at it? What do I do now?’” says Graham. “These are some strong emotions, and even if they\'re predictable, they can be unnerving.” In order to get to a really high-functioning, larger team, you have to help everyone get through this roller coaster. If you don’t, you can end up with a real mess.\n\nIf you personally want to grow as fast as your company, you have to give away your job every couple months.\n\nThat’s why her talk is about Legos. The emotions you feel when new people are coming in and taking over pieces of your job — it’s not that different from how a kid feels when they have to share their Legos. There’s a lot of natural anxiety and insecurity that the new person won’t build your Lego tower in the right way, or that they\'ll get to take all the fun or important Legos, or that if they take over the part of the Lego tower you were building, then there won’t be any Legos left for you. But at a scaling company, giving away responsibility — giving away the part of the Lego tower you started building — is the only way to move on to building bigger and better things.\n\n“Almost everything about scaling is counterintuitive,” says Graham. “And one of the foremost examples is that **reacting to the emotions you’re having as your team adds more people is usually a bad idea.** Everyone’s first instinct is to grab back the Legos that the new kid took — to fight them for that part of the tower or to micromanage the way they’re building the tower. But the best way to manage scaling (and one of the secrets to succeeding in a rapidly growing company) is to ignore those instincts, and go find a bigger and better Lego tower to build. Chances are if you pick your head up and look around, there’s a brand new exciting pile of Legos sitting right next to you.”\n\nThat’s one of the other counterintuitive things: Adding people doesn’t mean there’s less work for the people that are already there. It means that the entire company can do more. If one person was managing all of marketing before and then you hire someone to manage your content channels — the person who was doing marketing before is not going to have less to do. It either means that she\'ll be able to do the rest of her job better, or that she\'ll be able to take on new things.\n\n“People think, ‘Oh, that person joined! Now I can finally work a little less.’ But that’s almost never what happens,” Graham says. “Adding people is the opportunity to find a new job (or the new version of your old job). But this requires individuals to freely give away parts of or sometimes all of their old job — handing over projects, programs, products, code that they probably built from scratch. It means trusting other people with something you care about.”\n\nFor high performers in really fast-growing situations, this happens all the time. Graham emphasizes that one of the secrets of people who are really successful at fast-growing companies is how rapidly they\'re able to adapt to the chaos and uncertainty of adding new people. They become adept at redefining their jobs on a regular basis, and they become comfortable with the largely uncomfortable emotions that naturally happen when a team doubles or triples in a short period of time.\n\nAt Quip, Graham’s job changes every three months. This doesn’t mean her title changes, but the content of her work shifts radically. For example, she’s gone from basically being the only sales person (and the marketing person too!) to functionally operating as VP of Sales and Marketing. “Every three months, I go through a phase where I’m a little uncomfortable and certain I’m doing the wrong things or operating at the wrong level, but then it passes and I find my new job,” she says.\n\nA week ago, someone might have told you they hate their Legos and want to get rid of them. But as soon as you hire someone else, they suddenly want to hang on to all of them.\n\nGraham’s had the benefit of conditioning to weather these changes. At Facebook, when they were onboarding 20 to 60 people a week, she got _so_ used to ceding responsibility every three to six months that she considered it part of her job.\n\n**Her advice to managers?** “Honestly, the best thing you can do is normalize what people are experiencing,” she advises. “As a leader, you want to head it off at the pass and proactively say, ‘Hey, this is what you can expect to feel during this time of growth. It’s pretty universal. Other people are going through the same thing. I’ve been through it too. There’s no need to be scared.’”\n\nHelp them understand that the emotional chaos they feel is normal so there’s no need to overreact. And in fact, they should often do the opposite of what their instincts tell them: Don’t latch onto the Legos you had before. Give them away and move on to building the next taller, cooler tower.\n\n“Listen to the questions people ask during your one-on-ones or in team meetings. When you start to hear a lot of, ‘So… why did we hire that person?’ or ‘Do we really need someone to do that job?’ or ‘Is Suzie going to take over this project?’ Those are the signs that either individually or collectively, you should start talking to your team about giving away their Legos.”\n\nOne thing you can encourage people to do is not fixate or act on their emotions right when new people come aboard. Instead, tell them to ride it out and see how they feel in three weeks or a month — that’s when they should be coming out the other side and feeling better. Maybe set a meeting up to chat after that time has passed to see how things are going. That\'s a good way to keep an eye on how scale is affecting your team, says Graham.\n\nThe next best thing you can do is point to the new bright, shiny tower that needs to get built. At Facebook, one of her closest co-workers had built the beginning of a big project and their manager asked Graham to take it over. They wanted her co-worker to move on and focus on a new area that was even more important to the company, but she had a tough time letting go. “This was actually a very good friend, so it wasn’t that she didn’t trust me, she was just uncomfortable with giving away something she had started building,” she says.\n\n“That’s when our boss did this brilliant thing — he gave her a huge goal. He basically said to her, ‘We need you to do the same thing over here only five times bigger.’ Immediately, my co-worker let go of every single Lego she was holding and ran to the new project because she was so scared and excited. It was like someone had flipped a switch and she was suddenly like, ‘Good luck, peace out!’”\n\nOne of the best techniques for getting people through job-change anxiety is to help them picture the reality of their next job and the size of the opportunity.\n\nPeople get lost when they’re overly focused on the job they used to have and they can’t see what awaits them on the other side of these emotions.\n\n“If you want to be one of these type of people who started at Facebook at 25 people and ended up running a huge department, you have to get really good at giving away your Legos,” says Graham. “If you hold on to answering customer support queries yourself or writing all the blog posts yourself, you’re never going to run customer support or product marketing.”\n\n![](https://assets.proof.pub/2056/firstround/yr1gGLbqRhWkjTaarzYQ_lego.png)\n\nGraham says she sees this pattern again and again on teams she’s led, with people she’s coached, and with startups she works with at Quip. It seems like a fairly universal experience.\n\n“At Quip, we hear from a lot of startups as they grow past 50 people, and as they grow through the 300 to 500 phase. They’re looking for new ways to communicate, organize, and increase transparency in their organizations. They start looking for new tools in those moments in part because things are breaking. Those are very uncomfortable moments for scaling teams. It\'s when teams start to experience a lot of the growth challenges, and when you can start to see problems if you haven’t proactively managed your scaling process.”\n\nJust as the personal experience of scaling comes with a separate, unique set of emotions, the phases a company goes through each have a character all their own. As either an employee or a partner, Graham has experienced each of these phases in turn, has absorbed the challenges that come with each, and has seen these changes handled both well and poorly.\n\nWhat follows is a definition of each of these movements in a company’s life, with one caveat: Like people, companies are distinct in how they work, look and feel. One startup may still feel like a “chaosfest” (Graham’s word) at 150 people, while another might feel bureaucratic and static at the same number. It all has to do with the unique character of the company — how it was founded, who its founders are, its product, etc.\n\nGraham claims that for the majority of companies, the true chaos of scaling (and also the formation of most of your company’s identity) happens roughly between 30 and 750 people. After that milestone, the scaling emotions are more team-oriented rather than company-oriented — like “Wow, now engineering is growing so fast!” vs. “Facebook is growing so fast!” These phases and how to handle them apply to team scale as well.\n\n**30 to 50 Employees**\n\n“There’s something really interesting that happens when a company can’t fit around one table anymore — things just start to get a lot harder,” says Graham. “Where it used to be simple to communicate, people suddenly complain that they don’t know what’s going on anymore. They don’t know why you’re making certain decisions. They don’t know each other as well. They don’t know what they should be doing. I’ve seen so many companies really struggle in this phase.”\n\n30 to 50 people is where you go from being a family to being a company, and everything starts to get really hard.\n\nWith under 30 people, everyone knows each other well enough to walk up and strike up a conversation with practically anyone. You don’t even need to invest that much in communication. People can turn around in their chairs and talk to each other, and the priorities are clear because everyone’s talking about them all the time.\n\n“When things start to change at this tipping point, it’s the CEO who feels it most,” says Graham. “I’ve talked to a number of people who are experiencing this and they say it’s like night and day. At 50 people, everything that used to come naturally is now a struggle. And as a new leader, you start getting difficult questions that you’ve never had to answer before. I had a CEO tell me that someone asked them about their career path at the company, and they were like ‘I don’t know! Why are you asking that? We have so much to do!’ Or you have someone ask, ‘How do I do XYZ?’ and you want to say, ‘How do you not know that?!’ But it’s not their fault. Things have changed. You\'re a company now — not just a team — and you have to start acting like one.”\n\nThe best remedy here is to start writing things down — especially the stuff that\'s never needed to be formal or official before, like mission, values, philosophies. (You can see more of Graham’s advice on how to approach writing these things down [here](http://firstround.com/review/80-of-Your-Culture-is-Your-Founder/ "null").)\n\n“Who we are and how we do things — write that down as fast as you can before you hit rapid growth (ideally),” says Graham. “Yes, that might seem like a nuts thing to do at 25 people when you have so many competing priorities, but it\'s beyond worth it. At 750 people, you can tell the difference between the companies who did take the time to be thoughtful and record these things and those who didn’t.”\n\nYou also need to over-communicate. Once you’ve written down who you are and what you’re doing in the world, you should always be talking about it constantly. It’ll feel like you’re repeating yourself every day and every All Hands meeting, but that’s probably when you’re communicating just enough.\n\nSuccess at this stage isn’t coming up with a bunch of bloated or premature process — it’s about developing the right principles. This was Graham’s focus when she was helping Facebook solidify its culture. “Before we came up with a compensation system, we created a compensation philosophy that would guide how we’d think about paying people going forward. The philosophy helped us evolve our system as we grew. It more or less still guides the way Facebook does compensation today as far as I know.”\n\nPhilosophies can answer a host of questions about an organization: What does a high performer at the company look like? What role does feedback play? What is the role of a manager at our company? How can someone fail here?\n\n“Too many founders have this tendency to take a really elaborate process they see working somewhere like Amazon and then just grafting it onto their company — like some huge complex performance management system or engineering roadmap process,” says Graham. “At the end of the day, what early startups really need are design principles that tell them who they are, what they like, what they want to select for, and who they want to be. That is what helps you scale.”\n\n**50 to 200 Employees**\n\n“If we’re talking about child rearing, this phase correlates to those years right before adolescence,” says Graham. “This is an incredibly formative stage where you’re still small enough to change major things, people are still able to listen to you and hear what you’re saying fairly easily. If we use the metaphor of building a house, this is the foundation — and craftsmanship is incredibly important. This is not where you want to rush things. If you want your team or company to have certain values, to care about certain things, to have diversity (of thought, of identity), the time to do it is in these first 200 people — or the first 100 if possible. After that, a lot of other stuff takes hold.”\n\nHiring is a network effect. The first 100 people you hire will define the next 200.\n\nGoogle, Facebook and others have all conducted studies about what predicts the performance of a new hire. **The single biggest indicator is who they were referred by.** If you have high performers referring people, you’ll hire high performers. If you let low performers stay on staff because you’re too scared or insecure to fire them, then you’re building your future company in that mold. Early hires plant seeds. And what ends up growing depends on their character and commitment. That also makes this phase the most critical one for firing people (as unpleasant as that can sound).\n\n“The biggest favor you can do yourself, the other people who work for you, and really even the person you’re firing, is to just do it,” says Graham. “Otherwise you have really great people sitting next to low performers wondering why you’re paying them money. It really erodes confidence and has long-term ramifications. Really it should only take a couple months to assess whether someone is a good fit, and one of the healthiest things you can do for your company is — if the answer is no — part ways quickly. It doesn’t take a year to get to this answer.”\n\n**200 to 750 Employees**\n\nA company of this size has the temperament and biases of a teenager — and the growing pains to prove it. The personality and habits of the organization are pretty much molded. Now it’s all about scaling them as more and more people join. “You’re literally going through a growth spurt, and you have to really focus on getting your maturity to match your big feet,” says Graham. “A lot of how this phase feels has to do with how good of a ‘parent’ you were earlier on.”\n\nThat’s not to say you can’t make changes at this size. It’s just that everything is much harder — and gets increasingly so as you grow. Facebook was able to shift its personality away from moving fast and breaking things to thoughtful, rapid innovation after 700 people. But it was only possible, Graham says, because Mark Zuckerberg was so good at articulating what he wanted the company to do and feel like. After 200 employees, any shift in culture needs to be undertaken very deliberately and with a lot of work by the leadership of the company — the CEO, of course, but also the leader of every major department.\n\n“Think about parenting an average teenager — you have to decide how to handle the bad habits they spontaneously develop. You catch them drinking or doing drugs, for instance. How do you handle it? Maybe it’s just the one time, or maybe it’s a sign of something you actually need to address. It could be bad later on if you ignore it completely but you also can’t overreact.”\n\nAt an organization, you can see bad habits like people acting like assholes and getting away with it, and you have to decide how to respond. [Netflix’s famous culture deck](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664 "null") declares that they won\'t accept brilliant assholes. Sounds reasonable, but Graham would assert that there are many companies who do. “So the question is, what do you want your company to be like? When you see a trend over time that you don’t like, you need to aggressively manage it. Otherwise you can end up with some really bad habits as a company.”\n\nYou have to pounce on any bad habits that could become part of your company\'s DNA. Whatever your company looks like at this stage is how it will be, floor to ceiling, when you\'re older and bigger.\n\nOver 750 Employees\n\nTypically around this point, individual people’s identities shift away from the company and toward their team. They become Facebook engineers, for instance, not just Facebookers. CEOs may start to hear questions like, “What does the marketing team even do?”\n\nThis is also where politics start to emerge, gradually at first and then with greater momentum. **Graham defines politics as the moment when people start to act in their own self interest rather than the best interest of the company**. It\'s often shocking when it first shows up. It can be a sign that you hired too quickly or aren’t communicating proactively enough about what behaviors will be rewarded, and about what you’re doing in the world. Strong, constant communication with the leaders of teams is the only way to keep things healthy. Everyone has to feel that they and their work are clearly tied to the broader goals of the organization. Everyone has to own calling out bad behavior when they see it.\n\nThis is also when team leaders should look back at advice for CEOs to survive initial company scale. They can use most of the same tactics to keep their teams humming along without people feeling disillusioned or falling prey to the wrong priorities.

Who do you want to be? How do you want it to feel to work there?\n\nWrite down what you’re doing in the world. What’s your vision for the change you want to make?\n\nCommunicate these things again and again and again. Through all the channels. All the time. You can’t overcommunicate these ideas.\n\nFocus on hiring quality people rather than speed. Don’t lower your bar because you need to grow faster. It will come back to bite you.\n\nFire people. Just do it!\n\nHire amazing leaders as early as you can and help them grow their capabilities as the company grows.\n\nPrioritize principles over process.\n\nKeep giving away your Legos! And tell everyone around you to do the same. It’s going to be okay.\n\n_Looking for another colorful startup building metaphor?

After it’s done all these things, it draws the results of all its calculations to the screen, then does it all again 16 milliseconds later. In fighting games, this loop **needs to be tight and consistent** for all players who play your game, regardless of how fast or slow their computer is.\n* The game _only_ needs to send player inputs over the network to play online matches. We get to avoid sending complicated information about the game state and can save a lot of bandwidth.\n* When games send information to each other and then rely on the computers to independently run the simulations in sync, it’s said they are using **lockstep** networking.\n* Clients police themselves by asking each other periodically if they have the same game state.\n* When playing online, your own inputs are received immediately, but your opponent’s inputs for the same frame need to be sent over the network and will arrive late. The game needs a strategy for how it will deal with these late inputs while keeping the game feeling as close to offline play as possible.\n* **Delay-based** or **input delay**, is the simplest and most common implementation for games using lockstep networking. If a remote player’s inputs are arriving late because they need to be sent over the network, delay-based strategies simply **artificially delay the local player’s inputs** by the same amount of time.\n* The main problem is consistency. Because networks are notoriously inconsistent, delay-based strategies struggle because they are terrible at handling network fluctuations. Suppose there is a spike in the connection and some information from your opponent takes a little longer than the estimated 3 frames to reach you. Because the game simply cannot proceed without information from both players, it has no choice but to stop and wait for the input to arrive, causing the game to chug and lurch along during moments of prolonged network trouble.\n* Rollback’s main strength is that **it never waits** for missing input from the opponent. Instead, rollback netcode continues to run the game normally. All inputs from the local player are **processed immediately**, as if it was offline. Then, when input from the remote player comes in a few frames later, rollback **fixes its mistakes by correcting the past**. It does this in such a clever way that the local player may not even notice a large percentage of network instability, and they can play through any remaining instances with confidence that their inputs are **always handled consistently**.\n	$Act Now , Aplogize Later$\n* Rollback allows each client to **temporarily break the lockstep model** -- the game may be showing slightly different things to each player, depending on the connection quality and what’s happening at the time of the rollbacks. However, the game will **always correct itself** to be the same for both players whenever the inputs have been received a few frames later.\n* Rollback is **particularly great for lossy connections, like WiFi**\n* When input is missing, what rollback solutions actually do is **duplicate the last known input from the remote player** for the current missing frame. If they were holding down-back, the game predicts they will continue to hold down-back. If they were holding a button, the game assumes they are probably still holding that button. The game then runs with these predicted inputs for the remote player instead. All it really does is **assume the remote player has not changed their inputs** from the last time it received information from the network.\n* We can eliminate (frequent rollbacks) by combining delay-based and rollback solutions. In fact, every modern fighting game that uses rollback is built on a delay-based framework, with the important caveat that the delay is fixed at the start, and never changes.As long as the delay is **small and consistent**, players will quickly adapt and many will not even notice a difference from offline play.\n* [GGPO](https://www.ggpo.net/) Rollback open source implementation\n\n#networking #netcode",lastmodified:"2022-02-01T19:44:13.621530659Z",title:"Netcode 01022022"},"/Symptoms-of-bufferbloat-induced-congestion":{content:"Once a network is congested, various service protocols (statistically insignificant in terms of additional network load, but mission-critical) **can’t do their jobs**.

Packet loss is considered to be the result of network congestion and the congestion window size is reduced dramatically as a precaution.\n- However, wireless links are known to experience sporadic and usually temporary losses due to fading, shadowing, hand off, interference, and other radio effects, that are not strictly congestion. After the (erroneous) back-off of the congestion window size, due to wireless packet loss, there may be a congestion avoidance phase with a conservative decrease in window size. This causes the radio link to be underutilized. \n- Extensive research on combating these harmful effects has been conducted. Suggested solutions can be categorized as end-to-end solutions, which require modifications at the client or server, link layer solutions, such as Radio Link Protocol (RLP) in cellular networks, or proxy-based solutions which require some changes in the network without modifying end nodes.\n\n#networking \n#congestioncontrol",lastmodified:"2022-02-01T19:44:13.625530691Z",title:"TCP"},"/TCP-BBR":{content:"[Source](file:///D:/Program%20Files%20(x86)/New%20folder/bbr-2017-02-08-google-net-research-summit.pdf)\n## Intuition\n- Interpreting packet loss as congestion \n- When bottleneck buffers are large, loss-based congestion control keeps them full, causing [bufferbloat](BufferBloat.md).\n- When bottleneck buffers are small, loss-based congestion control misinterprets loss as a signal of congestion, leading to low throughput.\n- Using alternative metric as indicator for congestion\n### Why does congestion occur\n- Rate determing step is the bottleneck\n- Consider an analogy to fluid flow through a pipe\n	- RTProp : Round trip propagation time ~ Length of a physical pipe\n	- BtlBw : Bottleneck bandwidth ~ Minimum diameter of the pipe\n- [BDP Bandwidth delay product](BDP%20Bandwidth%20delay%20product.md) \n- Constraint lines intersect at inflight = BtlBw × RTprop, a.k.a. the pipe's BDP (bandwidth-delay product). Since the pipe is full past this point, the inflight - BDP excess creates a queue at the bottleneck, which results in the linear dependence of RTT on inflight data shown in the upper graph. Packets are dropped when the excess exceeds the buffer capacity.\n- **BBR** : A distributed congestion-control protocol that reacts to actual congestion, not packet loss or transient queue delay, and converges with high probability to [Kleinrock](Kleinrock.md)'s optimal operating point.\n## Identifying Bottleneck\n- Aim : highest throughput $\\uparrow$  \u0026 Lowest RTT/Delay $\\downarrow$\n- A connection runs with the highest throughput and lowest delay when (rate balance) the bottleneck packet arrival rate equals BtlBw and (full pipe) the total data in flight is equal to the BDP (= _BtlBw × RTprop_)\n- Caveat : BtlBw and RTprop vary over the life of a connection, so they must be continuously estimated.\n- [TCP](TCP.md) currently tracks RTT (the time interval from sending a data packet until it is acknowledged) since it's required for loss detection.\n- but a good estimate results from tracking delivery rate. When the ack for some packet arrives back at the sender, it conveys that packet's RTT and announces the delivery of data inflight when that packet departed. Average delivery rate between send and ack is the ratio of data delivered to time elapsed: \n			_deliveryRate =_ _Δdelivered/Δt_       $\\therefore deliveryRate\u003c=bottleneckRate$\n## Algorithm\n1. When an ack is received\n	Each ack provides new RTT and average delivery rate measurements that update the RTprop and BtlBw estimates.\n2. When data is sent\n	To match the packet-arrival rate to the bottleneck link's departure rate, BBR paces every data packet.\n		- pacing_rate is BBR's primary control parameter.\n		- cwnd_gain, bounds inflight to a small multiple of the BDP to handle common network and receiver pathologies\n3. Steady-state behavior\n	1. BBR minimizes delay by spending most of its time with one BDP in flight, paced at the BtlBw estimate. This moves the bottleneck to the sender so it can't observe BtlBw increases.\n	2. BBR periodically spends an RTprop interval at a pacing_gain \u003e 1, which increases the sending rate and inflight. If BtlBw hasn't changed, then a queue is created at the bottleneck, increasing RTT, which keeps deliveryRate constant. (This queue is removed by sending at a compensating pacing_gain \u003c 1 for the next RTprop.)\n	3. If BtlBw has increased, deliveryRate increases and the new max immediately increases the BtlBw filter output, increasing the base pacing rate. Thus, BBR converges to the new bottleneck rate exponentially fast.\n- BBR uses the code  (Matching the Packet Flow to the Delivery Path) for everything, handling events by sequencing through a set of \"states\" that are defined by a table containing one or more fixed gains and exit criteria\n### Single BBR Flow Startup Behaviour\n```mermaid \ngraph TD;\nStartup--\u003eDrain;\nDrain--\u003eProbeBW;\n```\n- To handle Internet link bandwidths spanning 12 orders of magnitude, Startup implements a binary search for BtlBw by using a gain of 2/ln2 to double the sending rate while delivery rate is increasing. This discovers BtlBw in _log2BDP_ RTTs but creates up to _2BDP_ excess queue in the process.\n- Once Startup finds BtlBw, BBR transitions to Drain, which uses the inverse of Startup's gain to get rid of the excess queue, then to ProbeBW once the inflight drops to a BDP.\n\n\n## References\n[ACM](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3022184)\n[Benchmarking blog](https://atoonk.medium.com/tcp-bbr-exploring-tcp-congestion-control-84c9c11dc3a9)\n[Spotify Engineering Blog](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2018/08/31/smoother-streaming-with-bbr/)\n[Dropbox Engineering Blog](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/optimizing-web-servers-for-high-throughput-and-low-latency)\n[Discussion Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/bbr-dev)\n\n\n#networking \n#congestioncontrol\n#Bufferbloat",lastmodified:"2022-02-01T19:44:13.625530691Z",title:"TCP BBR"},"/TCP-Cubic":{content:"[Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUBIC_TCP)\n- CUBIC is used by default in Linux kernels since version 2.6.19.

It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of your local files.\n\nThis step is **highly recommended**.\n\n🔗 [How to setup your Obsidian Vault to work with Quartz](notes/obsidian.md)\n\n### Ignoring Files\nOnly want to publish a subset of all of your notes? Don't worry, Quartz makes this a simple two-step process.\n\n❌ [Excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md)\n\n### Folder Structure\nHere's a rough overview of what's what.\n\n**All content in your garden can found in the `/content` folder.** To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any folder you'd like.\n\n**To edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.** This is the home page which is slightly special. You don't need front matter here!\n\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question.

Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site.

The only caveat is that you should reference them in your Markdown by prefixing it with a `/`.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.yaml` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)",lastmodified:"2022-02-01T19:44:13.749531665Z",title:"Troubleshooting and FAQ"},"/particularly-in-WiFi":{content:'Another major drawback of WiFi is that unless you have a MU-MIMO access point, your clients can\'t "talk" to the access point all at once.
