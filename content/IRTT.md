* Measurement of:
    -   [RTT (round-trip time)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time)
    -   [OWD (one-way delay)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_delay), given external clock synchronization
    -   [IPDV (instantaneous packet delay variation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_delay_variation), usually referred to as jitter
    -   [Packet loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss), with upstream and downstream differentiation
    -   [Out-of-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_delivery) (measured using late packets metric) and [duplicate](https://wiki.wireshark.org/DuplicatePackets) packets
    -   [Bitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate)
    -   Timer error, send call time and server processing time
-   Statistics: min, max, mean, median (for most quantities) and standard deviation
