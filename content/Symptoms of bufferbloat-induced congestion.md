title: "Symptoms of bufferbloat-induced congestion"

Once a network is congested, various service protocols (statistically insignificant in terms of additional network load, but mission-critical) **can’t do their jobs**. Here are some examples

-   DNS - adding hundreds of ms of latencies to turning a website into an IP address is **not** good. With a typical web page doing dozens, even hundreds of DNS lookups, DNS not getting through in a timely fashion results in vastly slower browsing.

-   NTP - the network time protocol - relies on somewhat timely delivery of packets in order to keep your computer’s clock accurate. Lots of things rely on accurate timekeeping.

-   ARP - the address resolution protocol - also relies on timely resolution in order to even find other devices on your network.

-   DHCP - if these packets are lost or excessively delayed, machines can’t get on the network in the first place.

-   Routing - many routing protocols depend on packet drops as a way of monitoring network health and are time sensitive.

-   VOIP - needs about a single packet per 10ms flow in order to be good, and less than 30ms jitter.

-   Gamers will get fragged a lot more often with latencies above their twitch factor.

-   IPv6 relies on even more specialized packet types for autoconfiguration, e.g. the equivalent of ARP

-   Encapsulated packets (VPNs, X11 over ssh, IPv6 over 6rd/6to4) also suffer.
