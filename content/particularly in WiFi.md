title: "particularly in WiFi"

Another major drawback of WiFi is that unless you have a MU-MIMO access point, your clients can't "talk" to the access point all at once. This causes higher latency and latency variation (Jitter [Jitter](Netcode%2001022022.md#Jitter)) as your PC must wait for "its turn" to talk to the access point, which also increases the risk of packet loss.
